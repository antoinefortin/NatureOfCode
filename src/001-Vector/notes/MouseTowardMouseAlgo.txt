To move an object toward the mouse, use this simple algorithm


Create a vector pointing from the ObjectLocation to the Mouse
1: Compute the mouse position in Vector2, 
2: Subtrack the position of the mouse and location of object    	
	PVector direction = PVector.sub(mouse, location);
  
3: Normalize the Direction Vector to be between 0 and 1,
4: Scale it by some value 
5: Make that direction the acceleration
